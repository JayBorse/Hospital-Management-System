# ðŸš€ Hospital Management System - Java Swing Project  

ðŸ“¢ **Excited to Share My Latest Project!**  

I've developed a **Hospital Management System** using **Java Swing** and **JDBC**, and I'm thrilled to upload it on GitHub for everyone to explore and learn from.  

## âœ¨ Features  
- **Add New Patients**: Register patients with details like ID, name, age, and disease.

- **Delete Patients**: Remove patient records from the database.  
- **Search Patient Details**: Retrieve specific patient information using their ID.  
- **Show All Patients**: View all patient records neatly in a scrollable table.  

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Java Swing (for GUI)  
- **Backend**: MySQL (for database storage)  
- **Database Connectivity**: JDBC  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Highlights  
- A clean and interactive user interface for hospital staff to manage patient data.  
- Robust CRUD operations to handle data efficiently.  
- Easy-to-understand code structure suitable for beginners to learn Java Swing and JDBC.  

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Project?  
This project is designed to showcase the practical implementation of **Core Java**, **JDBC**, and **GUI programming** in real-world scenarios. Itâ€™s perfect for anyone looking to build a hands-on understanding of **desktop application development**.
